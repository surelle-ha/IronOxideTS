A comprehensive boilerplate specifically tailored for creating and organizing a NestJS package. It serves as a foundational framework equipped with all the necessary configurations to streamline the development process. This boilerplate provides a robust and scalable structure, ensuring best practices are adhered to while building NestJS packages. 

It includes essential setup files, pre-configured tools, and integrations, allowing developers to focus on coding functionality without worrying about setting up the initial project structure. Ideal for those seeking a ready-to-use solution for rapid development and efficient package management in NestJS.

## Installation Instructions

To begin developing with Blitz, fork or clone this repository using the command below:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/surelle-ha/Blitz-Boilerplate
```
After cloning, update the details in package.json as needed. Next, install the required dependencies for the boilerplate:
```
npm install
```

## Development Instructions

After a fresh installation, your `src` directory should look like the following structure. You may modify it based on your needs, but ensure that the `index.ts` file is not removed:
```
ðŸ“¦src
 â”£ ðŸ“œblitz.controller.ts
 â”£ ðŸ“œblitz.module.ts
 â”£ ðŸ“œblitz.service.ts
 â”— ðŸ“œindex.ts
```
When you finish developing your package, make sure to update the `index.ts` file accordingly:
``` typescript
export * from "./blitz.module";
export * from "./blitz.service";
export * from "./blitz.controller";
```
To build and test your package locally, run the following command:
``` bash
npm run build && npm link
```
This will make your package available for local use. To test your package, navigate to another NestJS project and install your package:
```
npm install @username/blitz-boilerplate
```
> Note: Replace @username/blitz-boilerplate with your updated package name if it has been changed.

## Deployment Instructions

This boilerplate comes with two pre-configured GitHub workflows: one for pushing the package to GitHub Registry, and another for pushing it to the NPM Registry.

No configuration is needed for the GitHub Registry action. However, for the NPM Registry action, you'll need to generate an Access Token from the NPM website. After that, create a repository secret on your GitHub account named NPM_TOKEN. Once this is done, both workflows will succeed.
